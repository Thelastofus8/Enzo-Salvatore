In the silence of the night, memories whisper softly,
Of a love that drifted away like a ship at sea. 
Lost in the echoes of time, where dreams used to soar,
Now an empty space remains, where love lived before.

Longing for a love that once bloomed like a flower,
Now just petals in the wind, fading by the hour.
A love that slipped away, leaving hearts torn apart,
Yet in the echoes of the past, it lingers in the heart. 

Like a melody that lingers in the night,
A love that was once strong, now out of sight.
Searching for a way back to where we used to be,
In the depths of memories, where love set us free.

Um amor que se foi, a love that slipped away,
In the whispers of the night, it silently stays.
Hoping for a second chance to make things right,
In the echoes of the past, where love takes flight.
